# Anomaly-Detection-using-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
This project is developed to detect anomalies on the recorded data. It is deployed using Flask

To start the project we have to download Pandas and Numpy. It is done by using the command:

`pip install pandas`

The type command:

 `pip install numpy`
 
 Also type the command:
 
 `pip install matplotlib`
 
 Matplotlib is used to plt the data on graphs.

Remember that type these commands in Command Prompt or Windows Powershell or Terminal.

Then after the installation type the coommand:

`pip install sklearn`

Sci-kit learn is an open source library for using machine learning models. We can use any model from this library.

After installation type the command:

`pip install flask`

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

The after installing go to that directory where you kept the project. In the folder navigate towards the `app.py` file. Open command prompt in the current directory and type command:

`python app.py`

Wait for some seconds to automatically open a new browser window. The data which it accepts should not have any null values and consists of only two columns `imestamp` and `value`. The sample data files are in the project folder named as `data`.
